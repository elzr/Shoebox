***SHOEBOX*** is a CoffeeScript photo manager with physical interactions & sortings. 
It works best in Chrome, Safari, Firefox & IE9.
In IE8-, interactions are clunky but sorting's pretty smooth.

[CoffeeScript 1.1.2](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) is used, pretty idiomatically.
[jQuery 1.6.2](http://jquery.com/) and [Underscore.js 1.1.7](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) are assumed.
Blessed be John Resig & Jeremy Ashkenas.
